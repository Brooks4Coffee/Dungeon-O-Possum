The Dialogue Lines:
This script handles calling movement from other script, text and type, portrait to display, name to display, and event triggers. 
It is also a scriptable object that uses an array. 


Cutscene Manager:
Everything can be performed through a Cutscene Manager script. It will control the UI appearing, cycles through dialogue, and initiates other actions from other scripts


Cutscene Activator: 
  - Used to activate scenes (attach it to game objects you want to interact/talk to)
  - Uses DialogueLines to make full cutscene
  - Every activator IS its own cutscene


Cutscene System: 
  - Only ONE of these
  - Handles everything that happens during the cutscene (eg, clicking to go to next dialogue line)
  - Takes the dialogue lines from the cutscene activator and goes through them 1-by-1 based on player input
