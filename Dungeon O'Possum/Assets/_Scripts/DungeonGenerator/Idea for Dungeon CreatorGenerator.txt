Idea for Dungeon Creator/Generator: 

	- creator tab for making rooms:
		-> floor tiles
		-> wall tiles
		-> rewards
		-> enemies
		-> events
		-> lighting/special effects
		-> where it will connect to another area (via door or hallway)


	- Types of Rooms: 
		-> Room (abstract): has the tiles, lighting, and connections
		-> Rewards (abstract? inherits from room): treasure, weapon, 
		-> Fighting (abstract? inherits from Room): enemy, level of enemy (grunts, elites, boss), loot they drop
		-> Events(abstract? inherits from Room (and possibly rewards + fighting)): 
			-> might be a fighting room, quest event, treasure, etc... think Slay the Spire "?" rooms 
		-> Final reward + exit dungeon (inherits from Rewards? or just is rewards plus exit)
		-> Trade/Store (inherits from room): buy shit with the gold you get during your run

	- Map making tab for dungeon generator: 
		-> has a start, boss, and exit 
		-> you can choose the number of nodes between the start and the boss
		-> can do it by hand, or customize the percentages of which rooms appear more. 
		-> This also can check if player is in a quest that requires a certain map/room and adds it


	- Additional Features:
		-> mini-map
		-> map where you choose which direction to go like Slay the Spire, Cult of the Lamb, and probably more. 
		-> "Fog of War" in map and/or mini-map (hides rooms until player discovers them, could make interesting challenge)
		-> Coroutines when generating levels so it doesn't freeze
